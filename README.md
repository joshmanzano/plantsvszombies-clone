# plantsvszombies-clone
A plants vs zombies clone implemented in Java, created during my first undergraduate year (2016).

Made with pure Java from scratch without the use of a GUI editor (such as Netbeans or Eclipse) or external libraries.

To run, execute the following commands:
```
cd src
java ControllerDriver
```
